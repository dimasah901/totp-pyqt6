    <h3>Changing the settings</h3>
    To change the settings, click the <i>Settings</i> button. Then, the Settings page will open.<br>
    You can enable or disable autosaving by clicking on the "Autosave after" checkbox. To change the time (in seconds) before the database will autosave, edit the value inside the "Autosave after" field.<br>
    If a change is made before the database autosaves, the autosave will be delayed again.
    <h3>Manually refreshing the one-time passwords</h3>
    To manually refresh all one-time passwords, click the <i>Refresh</i> button. All one-time passwords are refreshed automatically, so you don't need to manually refresh them.
